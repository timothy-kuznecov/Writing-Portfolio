## The Train Traveller

There's a man who is known to appear on trains, that man is someone who visits a person who will die in the next few hours, no one knows what his name is nor who he is in general, he's a urban legend that people tell around, at campfires they tell scary stories of him visiting people who indeed did die in the next few hours. my friend Jonathan told me about his grandfather who got visited by the man, he remembers exactly the day that it happend.

"*We had a ticket from London to Manchester and we sat in the middle seats in the second or middle carrage you could say, you had 4 seats so they were in front of eachother, so we had 2 seats in front of us and i remember it like it was yesterday, he sat on the end side and i sat on the window side. That man came up walking up the isle, wearing that long jacket or how do you call it? oh yeah a overcoat i think, fully black with a sweater and chino pants, black shoes and a black fedora, like what you wear to a funeral*" Jonathan held his head in his hands, feeling the sadness through his body "
