## Aldonis: Part one, The war of Kermal

In a small town far from the normal world is a man named Arkon, Why does he live there? Who is he? No one knows, not even i know, How does the writer of its own book not know who its own character is? thats besides the point, it wouldnt be good for the plot to tell everything about my characters? how about i then tell the ending? does sound ridiculous does it? anyways, im moving beside the story, let me actually begin Aldonis.

Far far from land there exists a small town called Arkon, but when is a town considered small? Arkon has a population of 50,000 people where 30,000 are men, 15,000 are women and 5000 are childeren, Arkon has a small army of 30,000 soldiers which is also just men, because Arkon has a law that every man on the age of 18 has to join the army for 24 months and are free to stay after the mandatory time required by law, but trust me they will do anything in their power to keep you there for as long as possible, 

For as far as i knew my father was in the military, he was a sturdy man who always brought his experience into our household, he wakes me up every day at 5 A.M sharp, he enters my room with a steel pot and a wooden spoon then he clacked them against eachother, damn was it loud and it did work effectively.

"WAKEY WAKEY" \*clack clack clack\* "Rmng... Dad... its" I look at my bed side clock and see 

....5:00....

"Dad.. it's 5 in the morning, bit early dont you think?" "Early??\!\! Son.. when i was you're age i was running laps in the field at 5 in the morning, pfft.. early.." He said so in a mocking way, as he finished his rant he left the room and i was left alone to decide either if i was going to get ready or to stay in bed for a while, as i thought about it for a while i heard my dad yell from downstairs "ALDONIS, TIME TO GET UP, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE FIELD\!\!" hm... what could he have planned for me in the field? i stood up and made my bed then i made my way downstairs and saw my dad through the window in the field doing pushups, i sighed but forced myself outside "AHHH, there's my son, come over here" he gestured me to come, even tho i didnt want to, i forced myself to walk over to him
