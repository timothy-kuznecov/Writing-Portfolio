## The Purge

I open the door to my apartment "What the...?" my whole room was trashed and my windows smashed in, glass pieces everywhere. "Why me? WHY ME\!?" i walk around my house looking for my cat \*Lisa Lisa\* "Pspspspsps" i walk in my living room and see to my horror my cat lying on the floor, not moving, nothing.... i ran over to her and kneeled down next to her and pressed my ears to her chest, even through my heavy breathing i could hear a faint breathing noise "Thank goodness" i carefully grabbed my cat of the floor but there were to many glass shards on her, i quickly stood up and grabbed the only clean towel i had left, i ran back and placed the towel around my cat and picked her up and then placing her on my only clean spot of my couch, i thought of taking out the shards myself but quickly reminded myself that the shards keep her from bleeding out. after making sure that Lisa Lisa was safely put i grabbed my phone from my left pocket and calling 911\.

911 Operator: 911 what's you're emergency?

Zach: yes, my house has been broken in.

911 Operator: and what's your address?

911 Operator: We'll send some officers your way

Zach: Thank you kindly

911 Operator: Are the intruders still in the house?

Zach: uhm.. no i don't think so, i entered my house and it was a rampage in here, all my stuff have been thrown around, my windows have been smashed in and my cat.. i found her on the floor almost dead.

911 Operator: That's good to hear that you aren't in danger right now, i do advise to call the Emergency Vet after this call ends

Zach: Thank you, i will.
